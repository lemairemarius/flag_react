            <p>I got a surprise for you, Morty. I didn't. I did. Oh, man Morty. How DID she get there? Well, I-I-I think we've seen enough. I'll just figure out how to unplug this. Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit. I could--It could be Morty.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Absolutely. Uh, I was also late because of my drinking and metioned it to zero applause. A hair, Morty, I need one of your hairs! This isn't Game Of Thrones. I think planet Earth has just been transported. Mission accomplished, boys. Pull me out. Say it with me! Uh-oh! Spoilers!</p>
